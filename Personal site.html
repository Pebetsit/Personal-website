                <p id="description">I am a PhD student in physics with a strong analytical background and a growing
                    passion for software development. My research has trained me to approach complex problems with rigor
                    and creativity, and I’m currently expanding my skill set into full-stack web development. I’m
                    learning to build scalable, user-focused applications using modern technologies while applying my
                    data analysis experience to create meaningful, data-driven solutions. I'm excited to bridge
                    scientific thinking with software engineering to solve real-world problems and collaborate on
                    impactful, cross-disciplinary projects.</p>

                <p id="DS-description">I first became interested in coding because I was curious about how
                    technology works
                    and wanted to
                    build things myself. As a physics PhD student, I’ve developed a strong foundation in
                    problem-solving, data analysis, and computational thinking. Now, I’m expanding that foundation
                    into
                    full-stack development, learning to build web and mobile applications from the ground up. My
                    goal is
                    to combine scientific rigor with software development to create useful, impactful, and
                    data-informed
                    digital tools.</p>

                    <p id="SDA-description">I spent years synthesizing samples and working hands-on with
                        experimental and
                        simulated data
                        characterizing materials, extracting meaningful patterns, and communicating complex results
                        clearly.
                        This experience sharpened my ability to tackle problems with scientific rigor, critical
                        thinking,
                        and analytical precision.</p>
